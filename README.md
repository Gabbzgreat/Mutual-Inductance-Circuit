# Mutual Inductance Circuit Simulation  
This project simulates the transient response of an **RLC circuit with mutual inductance** using MATLAB.  
It includes three parts:  
1. **Solving ODEs using Numerical Methods** (Euler, Heun, RK4)  
2. **Nonlinear Mutual Inductance Analysis** (Interpolation & Approximation)  
3. **Power Dissipation Calculation** (Numerical Integration)  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The circuit consists of **two coupled inductors**, a capacitor, and resistors. The system is modeled as a set of **first-order ODEs**, which are solved using different numerical methods.
